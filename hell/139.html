<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You wait for the car to accelerate to what you imagine is a rate of speed deadly for 
the driver but safe for you and initiate your master plan.

You reach for the wheel and give it a hard yank.
Instantly, you, the man with salt-and-pepper hair,
and the car, have mounted the median and re-oriented ninety degrees.

“Stupid cock!” shouts the man, trying in vain to counter-steer.

Now it’s all flipping through the air like a centrifuge,
generating more than enough g-force to make you pass out,
but not before making you wish you’d never been born.
At least you aren’t conscious for your death, which happens 3.7 peeps later,
when car is reunited with tarmac, roof-side first.

-THE END-
