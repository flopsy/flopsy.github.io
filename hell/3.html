<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
Hunched over, with a sheepish grin plastered on your face, 
you light up another cooler and begin to shuffle around the checkpoint unseen like a master spy —
this might work out better than you thought it would!

Wordlessly and immediately, a FEDGOV Peace Meister Customer Satisfaction Expert wearing
dirt bike armor rushes up to you and starts digging through your pockets. 
He’s so close you can smell the back of his throat, 
and you can feel the outside of his protective groin armor brushing up against your own lower area. 
Every once in a while he gives you a quick pinch or a scratch just to make sure you’re paying attention.
You try counting the number of Hi-Nic cooler patches on his exposed skin but give up after ffteen.

These men are all dumb grunts who clearly aren’t interested in anything other than paycreds and pleasure.
A few of them are watching your little scene now, 
lightly fngering their triggers and running the palms of their hands along the underside of their heaters
in anticipation of some action and maybe some murderjoy.
The Commanding Superhero looks like he might be a different story however.
He’s a less brutally ugly looking man with a glimmer of intelligence in his eye,
and it’s possible he’d be receptive to a well-reasoned plea.

The gentleman looting your belongings and inspecting your teeth has you pinned up against the speeder, 
which has its key in the ignition and no driver inside.
You’ve never driven before, but your childhood hero and mentor, Roddy, gave you a full breakdown on the theoreticals.
If only Roddy were here now. He’d know exactly what to do to get you out of this jam.
They called Roddy The Pipe King, on account of his uncanny ability to 
find a pipe and hide in it at the first sign of danger.
One time, Roddy spent three G-Shock camped inside a satoig pipe, back when the Blowbang Gang had it out for him. 
They also used to call Roddy Twosoup — such was his knack for charming his way into double soup rations at The Lodge. 
There was honor back then, and family too, in small doses. 
Sure, you might spend all day working your fngers to the bone, picking through trash and manually processing satoig, 
but at the end of the day you could always count on a hearty bowl of clean soup with a few tarballs on the side. 
That was before the last embers of humanity died out and everything was bombed apart and scattered forever, blown away fucked up.

You are outraged.
This whole little ordeal violates so many codes and regulations it’s not even funny, 
not to mention the assault on basic human dignity.
If you could get the attention of the Superhero — 
educate him a little bit about your rights — he’d probably hear you out,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/6.html">and when he understands what’s going on he might even discipline this lout who is molesting you so grievously.</a>

These guys are no match for you, at least not with smarts.
You’ve talked your way outta worse jams than this — 
the problem here is that they just haven’t had a taste of your charm. 
You decide to think of something clever to say and then probably 
talk circles around these guys until they don’t know what hit ‘em. 
They’ll probably be working for you once you’d said your piece. 
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/4.html">They’ll probably start calling you Twosoup.</a> 

These guys are fuckin’ going to kill you if you don’t get out of here — 
that’s standard operating procedure when the citizen in question doesn’t have anything worth stealing,
and you don’t have anything worth anything. 
Time to make the only move you have left,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/5.html">smashing the pig in the face and praying you can get that speeder moving before the others turn their heaters on you.</a>
