<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You head west, or what you think is west, but might in fact be north,
figuring it’s safer than the other way — who knows.
You gotta get outta here. It’s all the same vast expanse of desert.
It would almost be nice to look at if you weren’t so pressed for time.
You know all too well that you’re close to running out of gas,
and running out means radiation poisoning and probably a painful, drawn-out death.
The speeder continues to carry along at a decent clip.
By your reckoning, the high-performance FEDGOV enjin probably makes the 
most efficient use of fuel higher up in the rev range, 
which in overdrive is about eight-five, but your nervous fixation on not dying causes you to 
be a little overzealous on the gas and average maybe one-two-zero.

For two swatch this carries on: a delicate balancing act with the soda temperature and
solar gas gauges on the one hand, and a giant cloud of 
radioactive dust trailing after the open-air buggy on the other.
You start to think maybe you’re seeing things, and in fact you actually are.
Trash, junked speeders and three-wheelers, piles of rubbish and scrap metal —
at frst just scattered here or there, but now a minefield of debris for you to dodge.
You’ll have to drive very carefully,
as it would only take one stray sharp object or biggish pothole to put your vehicle out of commission,
and you in the doghouse.

---

You decide to double-down and take your chances driving through the debris field.
If you concentrate and take it a little bit slower,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/281.html">you might make it through to the other side alive.</a>

You know one thing for sure: if you slow down now you’re dead.
Slaloming through sheet metal and chunks of concrete just isn’t an option.
You make a 90 degree course correction and head for open ground,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/329.html">keeping your speed up and staying safe.</a>
