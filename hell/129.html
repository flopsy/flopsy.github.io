<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You fly through the air like an eagle. 
You can see the ground rushing at you, but the speed of your thoughts is even faster.
Distance, wind projection, bearing, nautical speed â€”
you manage all possible variables simultaneously and visualize the perfect roll maneuver,
leading with your right shoulder and somersaulting around 
into a kneeling pose with one knee touching the ground, the other raised.
The ground comes as expected, and you execute the frst phase of the maneuver,
twisting yourself into a pretzel, which has the unintended effect of 
sending your spine backwards through your rear end in little pieces and breaking your neck like a used matchstick on impact.
Your brain and heart carry on as normal for a few more miniswatch,
plenty of time to consider which part of your acrobatic plan got fouled up.
