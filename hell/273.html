<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You kick over the can of gasoline,
spilling its contents everywhere.
You are now locked in mortal struggle,
fighting for your life, with gas fumes tickling your nose.

The man with salt-and-pepper hair headbutts you clean, right between the eyes, sending you to the ﬂoor quick.
You feel the gasoline start to seep in through your clothes.
You’re still dazed and unable to move,
but you remark to yourself that the gas has a curious effervescent effect, like peppermint.

Before you can decide what to do with this little piece of information, 
the man with salt-and-pepper hair yanks your head up and does you clean with a garrotte wire.

-THE END-
