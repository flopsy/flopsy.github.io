<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You push the Superhero by the shoulder to spin him around —
a move Roddy taught you during one of your many before bedtime combat training sessions.
Roddy never said anything about bioroboidry however,
and the polyresin fingers wrapped around your wrist feel so strong,
you think for a peep that they might actually snap your hand off.

The Peace Meisters come to backup their Blue Brother, but there’s no need.
The Commanding Superhero is perfectly capable of physically besting you on his own and
delivering a fatal killshotte judgment, which he does, to the chest.

As you lay in the muck, dying, your olfactory bulb registers some rather sickening smells:
muck, shottepowder, burnt circuitry, and the stink of your assassin’s infected implants.
What a way to go.
