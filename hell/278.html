“…and I actually think that, all things considered, Sterno’s doing a great job!
I mean, sure she’s inherited a lot of problems and she’s meeting with a lot of opposition, but you play the cards—“
The Superhero interrupts your thoughtful excretion with a swift slug to the stomach.
Just as soon as you double over in pain, two Peace Meisters hoist a prison barrel up and slide it down over you.

You’re now twisted like a pretzel and unable to see anything, which in a way is for the best,
because if you could see the Superhero’s cartoonish smirk you’d probably start puking.
It’s dark and hot, and your joints are already starting to hurt.
You are jostled and rolled over to the prison van, where your new home is stacked with the rest,
probably also filled with prisoners.

You forgot exactly how FEDGOV processes barrel prisoners,
but you do remember Roddy telling you it’s one of the worst ways to die, and you should try
to quickly starve to death if possible before reaching the barrel prisoner processing terminal.
You’ve got a few swatch at least before the prison van heads out, plenty of time to plan your next move.
