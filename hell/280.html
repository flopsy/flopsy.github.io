<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You’ve got a big smile on your face as you start down the highway on foot.
But you quickly remember that there’s no room for happiness in a place like this.
No room for happiness, no room for pride — those are things that’ll get you killed.
Here it’s only greed, hate, fear, betrayal — the worst aspects of man —
which can be counted as comrades in the fight for survival.
Far off ahead you see a big illuminated sign that reads Namerian Heroes.

It’s a gas station, but not bombed-out and depleted like they typically are.
Outside of a few solar-powered street lamps and the odd hand-cranked generator here and there,
you haven’t seen much of electric light, certainly never anything this big.
It’s a good hike from here, about 100 quads by the looks of it, but you can do it.
To the east is the dust-way—the cracked red salt ﬂats that lead somewhere.
The old timers used to always caution you about the poisonous dust, 
but for all you know that could’ve been a ploy to keep the treasures of Avalon known only to themselves.

---

That gas station will provide safe haven and the owner will most certainly lend a helping hand.
You set off towards the highway and the electric Namerian Heroes sign,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/471.html">whistling a tune, with a spring in your step.</a>

The gas station is sure to be some sort of trap —
you’re much better off going down the dustway.
Plus, you’re pretty sure all the stories Roddy and the gang used to 
kick around were just lies to keep you spooked, lies of cowards.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/334.html">With a spring in your step, whistling a tune, you set out towards the desert.</a>
