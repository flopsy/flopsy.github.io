<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You hike down the highway for quads and quads and quads.
Dusk comes, and you get a swatch’s sleep under the hazy purple light, 
tucked safely inside the trunk of a derelict car.

It drove you insane sometimes, the light of that dead sun—they say it moves closer every day,
but you can’t seem to tell. Night and day were just words for the cycles of pulsing brightness —
night was a deep purple hue that would drive men to commit insane acts,
and day was a dull, foggy red that was unsettling to say the least. 
Somewhere far off you hear the din of bandits reveling over a fresh kill—freworks and heatershottes into the air,
then the sounds of fighting, then more merrymaking, then more fighting,
and at last, quiet.

Another half-day cooking your feet on the sun-bleached pavement and you see another traveler,
this one on a two-wheeler, headed opposite yourself.
Evidently he’s so afraid of whatever’s behind him that he can’t be bothered to stop and shake you down or killmaim you. 
With wide, panic-stricken eyes fixed dead on the road in front of
him, he blows by you without even so much as a glance.
You wonder between the two of you who will wind up dead frst. Probably you.

More roads and more sleeping.
The sun is now like a joke you’ve told too many times,
one that comes to mind reﬂexively in conversations and makes you sick,
but you keep telling it anyway because you can’t think of better ones.
More quads, no people, but when you finally look up from your dirty shoes and the asphalt you’ve been pounding,
you find that the two eight-lane tiers of the highway have tapered down to a single four-lane road,
and off in the distance…
