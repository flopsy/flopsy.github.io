<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
This is the end of the dustway. You stand at the edge of a sweeping cliff, 
looking out upon the basin of what must have been a sea at some point.
It’s very beautiful, with the wind kicking up red sand,
and the cracked dry floor of some ancient ocean stretched out before you.
What would this have looked like three-thousand G-Shock ago,
when the world was literally covered in soda?

The radiation has already started to make your skin peel and your eyes hurt.
You figure you’ve got another couple swatch at least before you die,
time enough to enjoy the view and maybe rub one out.
You can count yourself lucky, to die gently in this place,
not surrounded by satoig and skinned alive by the freaks of humanity like most people.

Not bad, not bad at all.


-THE END-
