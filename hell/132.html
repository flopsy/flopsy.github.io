<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
As you crawl through the old buss on your hands and knees,
it becomes apparent that the last few travelers to take shelter here used it as a restroom.
It stinks bad, and every surface is sticky like gum with satoig and other excretis.
It’s unfortunate, but you just think back to Roddy,
what would Roddy do in this dire situation? —
Roddy would stick it out like a trooper,
for as long as was needed, and he’d get the job done.

You sense human eyes behind the boarded-up windows of the main building.
Most likely, whoever’s inside is trying to decide what to do about
the apparently abandoned speeder parked in their lot.

After a short while, a little man in blue coveralls walks out tentatively.
He’s carrying a big wrench for protection,
but he’s so small and old that even with this weapon you could easily overpower him.
Eventually he works up the courage to approach the car,
and fear turns to opportunism as he starts riffling through the various compartments looking for valuables.

This old man poses no threat to you now — you could easily kill him.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/137.html">You rush in and kick him in the back of the head.</a>

This old man poses no threat to you, in fact he might even be able to help you on your journey.
At the very least you should
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/133.html">ask him about this strange place and how it comes to be that he has electric power while the rest of the world is in ruins.</a>

There’s more than meets the eye at work here,
which is typically a sign that someone or something is about to make an attempt on your life.
There are a dozen ways you could play this — you could try to kill the man, make love to him, shine his shoes —
but the smart move here, the move Roddy would make, is to sneak off and be on your way with haste.
From your current position it would be trivially diffcult to crawl on your hands and knees farther down the road without being seen,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/11.html">and that’s just what you do.</a>
