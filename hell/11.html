<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
The highway is eight lanes wide, with two tiers.
The bottom tier is absolutely littered with wrecked vehicles.
This must’ve been the route people took to evacuate, for whatever reason, who knows how long ago.
It looks like most of them were too late.
In the distance you see fires burning, which must mean there are people.
You can’t be certain who or what you’ll run into walking this way,
but at least there’s cover for hiding if it comes to it.

The top tier — held aloft maybe two-and-a-half quads high by giant concrete pillars —
is clear of any traffic. Just open road as far as the eye can see, clean road, almost new in fact.
You’d make good time travelling this way, but if someone else comes along, you’d be totally defenseless.
No weapon, no cover.
Your only hope would be to jump off the side, and that’d be fatal, you reckon.

---

There’s nothing strange about the top tier,
it’s just road that they must’ve built and never got around to using.
<a href="./130.html">you step out of your speeder eagerly to greet the proprietor of this place.</a>

The bottom tier has signs of habitation,
which opens up the feld for a few possible dangers, but it also has cover,
the safety of which far outweighs those dangers.
<a href="./478.html">You crawl in there for a bit and wait to see what materializes.</a>
