<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
For a moment you just stare at each other in silence.
“I thought I’d never see you again kid,” he shakes his head,
“the rats got me good—got me on the run — and I thought without me around you’d be toast…
Hah, guess I was wrong. Looks like you’ve done pretty well for yourself.”
He grinds a smoking cooler stub out on the table, sighs heavily, and continues,
“I thought about you a lot kid. You showed a lot of promise,
scavenging and also with the whole testicle crushing thing, I always just wanted to
do right by you and make sure you knew what the deal was, ya know,
so when I was dead you’d be able to keep the flame going.
Everything’s so crazy, but you were my family.
I can’t tell you how many times I tried to send word by courier, it just sucks I don’t know how to write.”
Roddy looks down at the two cup soups sitting before him on the table and starts to tear up.
Soon he is violently sobbing, clutching at your clothes and mumbling incoherent apologies.

You reassure him that everything’s ok —
he taught you everything you needed to know,
and you wouldn’t have made it all the way out here if it weren’t for his tips and tricks.
After a while, he calms down, dunking a peanut butter chocolate sugar stick into his soup and crunching off one end.

He explains to you the secrets of Avalon,
and as it turns out, the rumours on both sides were wrong… but not entirely.
Avalon was some sort of luxury village,
a place where ancient warlords would go to get helping hands and warm beds to sleep in,
and to be worshiped by slaves and anointed in fine oils —
or at least that’s the impression you’re left with after Roddy explains it several times.
He shows you a tattered piece of paper with a picture of a healthy-looking man being
rubbed and worshiped by a beautiful slave boy.
In the background of the picture are the Avalon gates,
and at the bottom there are words in some alien script: “Pamper Yourself!” —
you figure the writing must be some sort of warning,
most likely that the healthy-looking man is a great warlord,
and if you trespass on his keep or try to steal his slave, you’ll become one yourself.
This paradise of wine and slaves is now almost totally vacant, with one catch —
the roboidic control system that the ancients designed never got the message when
its human overlords packed up and moved on.
And so, Roddy tells you, laughing to himself, until their hydrogen fuel cells give out,
or their automated repair facility runs out of sand and graphite, the roboids will continue buzzing around on
behalf of their non-existent clientele and upper management,
repelling invaders and even hiring human underlings for certain low-level tasks.

The rumors were both wrong, but not entirely. Avalon wasn’t a hell, and it wasn’t a heaven;
it was just another dangerous scavenging spot for you and Roddy to pick clean.
The junkyard was his safe haven, a base of operations,
and hidden in the heaps of seemingly worthless rusted metal, you soon learn,
Roddy had amassed a lifetime’s worth of valuables and treasure.
He has fur coats, old magazines, office supplies, and as many car tires as you could ever need.
Blankets of every variety, furniture, aluminum cans, children’s toys —
you can hardly believe your eyes as he shows you his masterstash.

The best news of all? He’s got plenty of tomato soup and cocktail wieners,
and now he’s got someone to share with.
The Adventures of Roddy and You, Part 2!
