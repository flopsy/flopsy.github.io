<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You casually about-face and shuff le back down the street,
dragging your heels and coughing like a sick person (you are sick).
Maybe a fresh cooler will soothe your throat, and so you light up your last Mammie’s.

The street is littered with rubble and human remains —
corpses stripped of their shoes and whatever valuables they may have had, mostly in skeleton form.
There are big concrete fragments from collapsed buildings,
exposed soo pipes full of stagnant satoig, and hardly any of the solar-powered street lights are functional.

This whole hellish scene is enhanced by the eerie red light that paints everything, night and day.
You’ve heard legends told that it was once not like this —
the world used to alternate between a great brightness that flled everything with
life and a total darkness for restful sleep and stealthy killing.
All anyone living these days had ever known was the red and purple glow,
a persistent dusk that provided no nourishment and no peace and made everyone sick in the head.

Boarded-up and blacked-out windows in the buildings that still stood were all potential traps.
Behind any one of them, a predator of some sort or another was probably waiting for you to walk by,
waiting to drink your blood or eat your hair or relieve themselves in your rear-end.
From behind you hear the distant brap of the twin-enjin FEDGOV speeder fring up.
Maybe they’re going for a leisurely cruise, maybe they decided to pick you up and interrogate you,
or maybe they’re coming to turn you into road kill —
you only know that it’d be a mistake to hang around and fnd out.
A few quads ahead of you is a dumpster you could probably hide in.
Beyond that, there’s an alleyway that could be a decent 
hiding spot if it’s not home to a ravenous pack of Wasters already. 

---

The dumpster looks safe and inviting, 
and it won’t be your frst time using one for shelter.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/135.html">You decide to go for it—hopefully it won’t be occupied.</a>

Chances of finding an unoccupied dumpster nowadays are slim to none.
Not to mention that’s the frst place the Cop-O’s would look for you.
It makes much more sense to head down the alley -
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/136.html">you’re positive there’ll be a piece of trash or a pile of trash for you to hide under down there.</a>

They’re going to fnd you no matter what.
Your only hope is to go back and beg for some easy treatment.
Who knows, maybe they’ll give you a helping hand once they bioscan your
estrogen levels and see that your hormones are in line with regulations.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/474.html">You walk back towards the checkpoint to turn yourself in.</a>
