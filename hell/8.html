<pre class="top">
You make it about fifty quads out into the ﬂat,
red expanse of the dustway when the air starts 
to sting your nose.

Could it be that all the big talk from the older scavs is true? 
Possibly. 
Then again it could just be that the air out here is drier than you’re used to.

You lend no credence to the war stories of paranoid old fools.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/9.html">You’re gonna keep heading out this way and when you get back you’ll have a tall tale of your own to tell — a true one.</a>

You still have a hunch the warnings you hear from the old-timers are all lies,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/7.html">but it’s best to play it safe and head back anyway.</a>
