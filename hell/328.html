<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You feel comfortable here,
in the safe shade and cool breeze of the garbage troughs with their 
high canopy of iron girders and scrap tin.
You may be a long way from home, but after a few swatch of scuttling along the 
ground on your stomach and using your nose to sniff out the best hiding spots,
you know this junkyard like the back of your hand,
and this new base should provide you with a good base of operations for your grand infiltration of Avalon,
if that’s what you choose to do next.

You collect aluminum cans well into the afternoon,
pushing around an old rusted shopping cart like Cowardly Joel used to do back at The Lodge.
Of course this activity serves no purpose (though it is possible you could use these cans to fashion some sort of helmet) —
you mainly do it for the familiarity and comfort.
Collecting cans is an exercise that always helps you think.
You’ve actually come up with some of your best ideas while collecting cans,
such as your coffee filter breathing mask,
and the spring-loaded ventilation shaft traps you made for catching bandits and ventcrawlers back in the wild open days.

All throughout this, you can’t seem to shake the feeling of being watched.
You feel eyes burning through your back,
but when you whip around — can opener poised to defend and counterattack --
there’s no one there.

A shadow moves, and it’s real movement this time, not just your imagination.
You spin full circle, and there, peering at you through the hole of a tire, is the junkyard groundskeeper.
He’s a bit older, ruddy-faced with a red beard, red and white striped conductor’s cap, and dingy brown coveralls.
He is holding a magnificent junkyard foreman masterstaff,
covered in beach glass jewels and bits of brass and other precious metals.
He stares at you, clearly sizing you up.

---

There’s something familiar about this man, something disarming.
From the way he sized you up, you can tell he’s old school, 
and has seen his share of scraps and deathfights,
but he doesn’t jump to needless aggression -- he’s a class act.
The masterstaff seals the deal as far as your initial evaluation of the groundskeeper goes —
they don’t just hand those out to anyone, and the fact that he’s got one means he can be trusted.
You decide to approach the man and learn a little bit more about this place,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/331.html">maybe get a friendly helping hand.</a>

Something about the groundskeeper’s eyes doesn’t sit quite right with you.
The vibes here have been wrong this whole time, graveyard vibes.
When he sized you up, he was probably wondering how good you’d taste marinated in Crisco and rat juice. 
You don’t have time to contemplate whose corpse he pilfered the junkyard masterstaff from,
because you’re already scrambling around, trying to find a safe refrigerator to hide in.
You decide to find a cardboard box or other domicile,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/332.html">lay low until duskfall, then hightail it out of here.</a>
