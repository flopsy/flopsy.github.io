<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You sit up and throw a fierce right hand at the side of the man’s head.
He must not have expected a counter-attack from you, in your bloody and bruised state,
because his head wavers sideways and then down, indicating the effectiveness of the blow.
Without wasting any time, you stick both thumbs right into his eyes, getting him good.
He screams, and the car whips into the median at a speed of about seven or eight.

The man claws at your crotch and gives several crushing squeezes,
squeezes that would make a normal man wish he’d never been born,
but you use the pain control technique that Roddy taught you to make it feel little more than a gentle caress.
When the salt-and-pepper haired man realizes he’s getting nowhere with your groin,
his hands move to shield his face, but it’s too late.
Your fingers are so deeply buried in his eye sockets that it’s eye soup.
The car scrapes along the concrete barrier in the middle of the road,
barely scrubbing any speed off at all.

Suddenly there must be a blow-out or some tie rod snappage,
because the front fender digs in hard and the back of the car is sent spinning around.
