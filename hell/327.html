<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You walk through the junkyard entrance.
The scene is like nothing you’ve ever seen before —
sheet metal warehouses that look brand new, gleaming in the sun…
fancy brick buildings, clean chain-link fence everywhere, smooth healthy pavement.
No humans in sight, just a few roboids buzzing here or there, carrying out light duty labor of some sort.
Never in your life have you seen so many undamaged buildings.
It dawns on you that this must be where the important people live.
Perhaps this is where powerful warlords hoard their solar gas and canned food,
behind the sparkling steel and cinder block walls.

To the west you see what looks like the unguarded entrance to one of the larger warehouses.
Perhaps inside you could find some cans of food or maybe a comfortable piece of cardboard to sleep on…

Up north, there are more lights and more roboids buzzing with activity.
Squinting your eyes, you can even just about make out some people — yes,
it looks like a gathering of some sort, probably a barbeque.
Maybe these kind souls could direct you to a hot meal and a warm bed!
Your eyes glaze over as you imagine what it must be like to take a bath in hot soda.
These people clearly have such resources and such nice warehouses,
surely they will let you have a taste of luxury…
Maybe they’ll trade you for your rat carcass cloak that has served you so well these past few G-Shock,
or for the can opener you keep on a string around your neck —
those are the most valuable things you own…

---

You approach the party and trade your prized can opener for a
steel residence and a brand new wardrobe,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/335.html">and your rat-carcass cloak for a new speeder and a small stockpile of food.</a>

You go for the unguarded entrance, 
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/333.html">hoping to find many valuables and dehydrated food stuffs.</a>

There’s something not right about all this.
The lifeless efficiency of these roboids ﬂying around is unsettling…
You don’t know what’s going on here but you have the vague sensation of trespassing.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/328.html">You turn back to the junkyard and try to glean what information you can from the safety of trash and shadows.</a>
