<pre class="top">
You use your arms to reel the man in and meet him halfway with a clean headbutt.
The blow is perfect, hitting him right between the eyes and instantly dropping him to the ﬂoor, a bloody mess.
Not wasting any time with formalities, you pin him down, knee to chest,
and pistol whip him hard in the face and head with his own heater,
hitting clean, until you believe him to be sufficiently passed-on.

While it certainly can’t be said that you went about things the easy way,
his stash, which you suspect to be measurable, is now yours, 
by Hell law both common and ancient.
