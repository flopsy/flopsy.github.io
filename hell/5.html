<em>If this is your second time reading this page then you’re already dead. 
If you have to ask how or why, you’re dead. The End.</em>

You jump into the FEDGOV speeder, turn the key, mash the pedal to the ﬂoor and peel out righteously.
From behind, you can hear men clamoring and heaters firing,
but thanks to the massive dust cloud kicked up by the spinning wheels,
none of the troopers are able to draw a bead on you until you’re well out of range.
You take a nice long final drag of your cooler and ﬂick it over the side.
Ahead are the orange sodium-vapor lamps of the deserted freeway, some still ﬂickering with solar power.
A little ways beyond is a gas station, Namerian Heroes, that looks promising.
Your mentor, Roddy, told you that the highway is very dangerous—full of bandits and booby traps —
so maybe it’d be best to look for a helping hand at this rest stop.

To the east is the dustway — a vast expanse of toxic
red desert that brave fools set out on in search of Avalon.
There are no bandits this way, but if you stop or slow down long enough for your dust cloud to catch up to you,
you’ll be dead in miniswatch, asphyxiated by radioactive soot, or so they say.
Back behind you is the checkpoint.
They haven’t given chase, probably because the speeder would outrun that van easily.
However, it’s also possible that they’re all laughing right now,
maybe because you’re driving around with some sort of remote detonation device,
or maybe just because the outlands are so dangerous you’ll be dead soon no matter what.

---

In a situation like this your best bet is to rely on the kindness of others.
Outlanders are a different breed and if there’s anyone staffng that gas station
they’ll be sure to give you a helping hand and then some.
Plus you’re driving a remote-activated time bomb—gotta ditch this thing as soon as possible.
<a href="./10.html">You light a fresh cooler and drive on to Namerian Heroes.</a>

That freeway is a warzone death sentence, full of land mines and road pirates and daymares and who-knows-whatelse.
Your only way out of this jam is clear: through the dust.
<a href="./330.html">You cross your fingers, light up a fresh cooler, and hope this speeder is up to the challenge.</a> 

There’s probably a better option that you’re just not thinking of.
It dawns on you that you have the wheels — you are in a comfortable position and not too much danger,
so why not circle around the block and think things through?
Honestly, take fve miniswatch and come up with a better plan — don’t do something hasty and get killed.
