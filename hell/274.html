<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You whip a savage kick right in between the man’s legs, striking him clean, but he doesn’t budge!

Impossible…

There’s only two people on the whole planet who could take such a clean kick to 
the jewels without buckling from the pain: you, and Roddy.
Roddy who had taught you so many G-Shock ago, back at The Lodge, his secret pain blocking techniques…
You stayed up late, many a night, practicing and practicing —
gruelling work, it was — until the master was satisfied with his pupil.
G-Shock later your ability to block out pain, specifically testicular pain,
was unrivalled by all save The Pipe King. And now…

Could it be that you’ve met another?

The man with salt-and-pepper hair simply smiles at your failed attack,
and retaliates with his own: a truly furious ﬂurry of knee strikes up into your pelvis.
One, two, three — his legs move so fast it seems as if he’s tap dancing.
Four, five, six, seven, eight — each strike more forceful than the last,
all hitting clean, enough to pulverize a normal man to dust. 
But you’re no normal man.
If you could withstand Roddy’s crushing hands and pinching fingers, you can withstand anything.

When the man with salt-and-pepper hair realizes that you’re unfazed by his all-out volley of
below-the-belt strikes, his jaw drops to the floor, and the strength fades from his hands.
Now would be the perfect time to finish the fight,
but one look into his eyes tells you that perhaps a fight won’t be necessary.

“Kid… who taught you to do that?”
