<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
Careful not to drop your cooler, you gingerly slip inside the dumpster.

Inside: three bodies—two dead and one in heavy narcosis — definitely not a threat to you.
One of the dead ones has a carved up face, covered in initiation scars,
which leads you to believe he’s a Waster. On his wrist is a timepiece,
probably a nice one, you suspect, from the feel of the real metal clasp.
It’s almost certainly broken, but you should still be able to trade it for a pigeon roll-up,
or maybe a capful of Icy Hot. He doesn’t mind you taking it.

Rummaging through the pockets of the other two, you strike gold!
First a cooler pack, quarter-full, and then hard knurled plastic, clanky cold metal bits —
in the darkness your blistered and liver-spotted hand has found a heater!
Your cheeks burn and you realize you’re reflexively smiling a hundred quads wide —
not the soulless smile of a man with doll eyes — the realest of real smiles:
the smile of a man who’s packing.

The coppery smell and the thick consistency of whatever liquid you are crouching in indicate that, as you suspected,
it is a pool of blood about oneand-a-half cans deep.

Outside, the Cop-O’s blare past without stopping.
They won’t be nabbing you today. Double lucky, just like Twosoup.
Twosoup, sometimes known as Roddy, was your friend, mentor, and savior,
and he was also the greatest scavenger that had ever been.
Damn, he would be proud of you if he could see.

Contemplating your good fortune and enjoying the heat in your palm,
you fail to hear the approach of a scavenger pack.
By the fast high-pitched chattering you can tell they’re Ratters —
deadly and not to be trifiled with.
Roddy once made the mistake of trying to cheat a Ratter in a game of enchanted cards,
god-damn near got his fucking head ripped off.
Three or four mean rats are now rummaging through trash piles outside,
probably on their way to your dumpster.

---

There are worse ways of dying than getting your groin bitten off by a Ratter,
but you can’t think of any right now. 
<a href="./200.html">Your only hope is to slowly, without making eye contact, raise the lid of the dumpster and surrender your boots.</a>

It’s been a while since you held heat like this.
The memories of the good old days make you giddy—blasting people for no reason,
no reason at all other than you could and they didn’t — man that’s the good stuff.
Whoever’s out there, two, three, four guys,
you’ve got the jump and you know for a fact that you can put them all on ice before they know what hit ‘em.
<a href="./202.html">You ﬂy out of the dumpster, heater blazing.</a>
