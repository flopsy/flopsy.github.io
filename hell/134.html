<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You ﬂy through the window to be greeted by a hellish punch to the face.
You can taste your blood and hear the roar of the enjin—the car’s peeling out,
but you’re still in it.

“Just what the fuck are you doing kid?!” shouts the salt-and-pepper haired man.

“Urgg, gah…” Your response doesn’t come out the way you wanted it to,
and you inadvertently spit blood and a single tooth onto the tan carpet interior.

Despite your loss of the frst battle,
this is a war you could still easily win.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/283.html">You punch the man back and go for his eye sockets with your thumbs.</a>

You’re screwed.
This guy’s a tough customer and it looks like you’re along for the ride.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/546.html">All you can do now is sit back and try to calm down.</a>

The car’s going real fast already.
The best possible move would be to jerk the steering wheel.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/139.html">He’ll die in the wreckage and you’ll make it out OK, you know it.</a>
