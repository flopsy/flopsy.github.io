<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
Odd that you should develop a slight cough out here where the air is so fresh and untainted.
At least you can relax without any marauders or traps to hassle you —
buncha cowards believing some old crap story. 
This place is about as toxic as your foot.

Another half swatch in and your cough starts to produce blood.
It burns your nose and chest to inhale and your mistake is clear to you now.
They were telling the truth about this place.
The dustway is vast and seems to stretch out forever in all directions.
The highway and the city are little miniatures on the horizon behind you,
and everywhere else you see what must’ve been the basin of a sea at some point.
It’s beautiful —
the wind kicking up clouds of red dust and whipping them into a frenzy,
the cracked dry ﬂoor of some ancient ocean…
What would this all have looked like three thousand G-Shock ago, when the world was literally covered in soda?

Your skin is starting to slough off and you feel nauseous.
You figure you’ve got maybe a swatch or less until you’re dead.
There’s time to enjoy the view though, and on top of that you can count yourself lucky,
dying gently in this quiet place, not surrounded by satoig and skinned alive by the freaks of humanity.
Today was a good day after all.
