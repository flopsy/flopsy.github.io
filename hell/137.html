<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You rush the old man and go for a classic jumping kick to the back of the head,
but he’s too quick, and what’s more is that he’s packing.
He spins on you, raising an old-time Tatov heater (six shots, deadly at close range)
which connects with your failed headkick, barrel to foot, and goes ﬂipping through the air.
The old man, in actuality not old or frail in any way,
tackles you at the hips and pummels you into the ground.
His thumbs go into your eyes and you scream with fear and pain,
but by some stroke of divine luck, your ﬂailing arms fnd the heater in the dirt.

Holding the heavy Tatov by the barrel, you swing hard and nail him right in the temple with the iron buttcap.
The strength in his hands instantly fades, and when your vision returns a moment later,
you see that his eyes are rolled up into his head, and his mouth is all jacked up to the side.
Not dead in the technical sense but near enough for your satisfaction.
Around his neck you find a rather stout-looking key,
more industrial than the keys you’ve seen before.
It must be for an important lock. 

In his pocket is a small ledger book, which looks like this when opened to a random page in the middle:

Figueres fore Festivus of an Unfortunate Jeeshock
Out-landres: 8
Hellholers: 1
Feddgove: 0
Othre man: 1
Othre childe: 1
12 Large pile jerky

---

This key obviously unlocks something valuable.
Your suspicion about the gas station being a trap is probably right,
but you also probably just incapacitated the only person who can spring that trap.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/473.html">Thinking the place safe to explore, you stumble towards the building in search of treasure.</a>

You got your jollies — no need to push your luck now by getting in too deep.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/67.html">You head back to the highway and continue your journey.</a>
