<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You are a hotshot and you know you can talk your way outta this one.
You know what unites all humans—warmth, compassion, laughter, good cheer.
Back in the camps before The Big Bang they used to call you Twosoup because you could always talk your way into two bowls of soup.
Well, actually it was your mentor and protector, Roddy, who earned that moniker.
After he passed on, you had always hoped someone would notice the similarity and start using that handle for you,
but instead they called you Shine-Po, on account of how you’d always make a life of poverty
seem to shine in the sun, with your gilded words and inspiring tales.
And that’s just what you’ll use today to worm your way out of a tight jam.

You clear your throat and call over to the Superhero for help.
The Superhero passes off a clipboard with names on it to his lieutenant and walks briskly over to you.
It looks like he’s smiling, but it’s only the mouth that smiles.
The eyes, on the other hand, are unemotive, hollow—like a doll’s eyes.
This man is a sadist, more so than any of the other troopers here,
and the business end of his heater is now pressed up against your left temple.
His implants must’ve gone septic because he stinks like a festering wound.
All the troopers are now looking at you.
Some have their heaters trained on your head, some just watch and wait.
It’s time to start talking and talking fast.

These folks respect authority because they are authority.
If you prostrate yourself and avow your support for Sterno and her High Command, they will probably not harm you,
in fact they might even let you join them and give you a helping hand.
<a href="./278.html">You kneel on the ground and express your love and affection for FEDGOV Central Chief Sterno.</a>

The psychopath currently pointing a gun at you has a nice black stain on his two front teeth 
where a HiNic cooler must make its home several times a day.
That’s a major health risk — mixing coolers with the high doses of antibiotics and
painkillers these guys take to balance out their cheap bioroboidic implants.
And yet they all have the look of habitual smokers — they’re probably very frustrated with their jobs…
<a href="./7.html">If you insulted FEDGOV Central Chief Sterno, cracked a joke or two about that old mulatto bull-dyke, then maybe these guys would ease up a bit.</a> 

Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of these guys blowing your brains out right here, right now.
It was a mistake to try and talk your way out,
<a href="./279.html">a mistake which you will rectify now by using the Superhero as a human shield and sending the rest of these thugs to early graves, deep.</a>
