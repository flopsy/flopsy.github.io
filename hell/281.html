<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
The junkyard landscape is becoming more perilous by the miniswatch.
You swerve hard to the right to avoid an overturned refrigerator,
and nearly take off one of your wheels in a giant pothole.

You can see, not too far off in the distance, huge mounds of trash and metal,
with only a few narrow paths cut through the mess for you to drive through.

You bring the speeder down a bit to make the obstacle course more manageable —
down to fifty, then a little over thirty-five, hoping that’s still fast enough to
not be consumed by the cloud of radioactive dust trailing the open-air buggy.
