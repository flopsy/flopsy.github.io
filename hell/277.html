<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
The inside of the satoig pipe reeks to high heaven,
but at least it’s safe. For the first few swatch, you trudge through the muck with high spirits,
skipping and splashing through the stuff,
happy to have been spared the agony of a Cop-O’ encounter.
Soon, however, fatigue starts to get the best of you,
and you are forced to make progress crawling on your hands and knees.

Satoig permeates through all the seams of your clothing and into every bodily orifice as well.
A slick flm coats you, turning your joints to greasy swamps of excreat,
and in places with less motion, it dries and ﬂakes off like troggy skin.
Here in this pipe, surrounded by darkness, probably a half-day’s walk from any opening,
you brieﬂy allow yourself to realize how low life has got you.
You are on your knees, wearing who knows how many peoples’ satoig like a costume,
and not only that, you’re thankful. Thankful and relieved to be swimming in waste.

“Look at me, everybody! I’m Shit-Man!”

The words were supposed to come out sounding like a salesman’s, sarcastically charged with bogus enthusiasm,
but had someone been around to hear them, the depth of your awkward pain would’ve been obvious.
If there’s anybody on the planet with less luck, wealth, strength, backbone, or intelligence than you… well,
theirs would be a pitiable lot indeed.
But there’s probably not.
You’re probably the worst in every possible category.
