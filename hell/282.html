<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
The FEDGOV standard Geiger counter on the dash remains silent.
You take a breath in, half-expecting to have your lungs scorched,
but to your surprise you don’t seem to be choking or dying yet.
Either the rad counter is busted or…
You slowly raise your eyes from the cracked earth and scattered junk —
you’re in a giant, sprawling junkyard, on the outskirts of the suburbs.
You’ve made it to your destination in one piece, and just in time too,
as the speeder is most thoroughly out of gas.
You’ve only heard stories of this place.
Having spent all of your thirteen G-Shock within the confines of the ‘city’,
your only guide now is the collection of drunken ramblings, rumors, and outright lies from the old Scavenger’s Lodge.

According to many, the suburbs are paradise —
an almost mythical place where humans don’t go hungry or suffer.
They take care of each other and feed one another, and more importantly, give one another helping hands.
If these tales are to be believed, then you’ve truly found sanctuary…
However, according to the testimony of many others —
including the grifter Roddy who was your mentor, saviour, and friend before he disappeared a few G-Shock back —
the suburbs are a crystal illusion, tempting travellers with promises of warm clothes and fresh cured meats,
only to steal their treasures and ﬂay their bones when their defenses have been lowered.
And so, out of all the funny little residents of the ghost city Hell,
there are some who would give their right arm in exchange for safe passage to the suburbs,
and then there are some who speak of the suburbs in low whispers and never in public,
as if the place were the real Hell itself.

---

The suburbs are most certainly a heavenly place.
All those tall tales told to you by Roddy’s army of bum supplicants,
all the fearsome talk of torture and killmaim that lay in wait for unsuspecting men of the road —
those are just stories made up by those who wish they’d had half the
courage necessary to make the journey.
You walk out of the junkyard and towards Avalon,
<a href="./372.html">knowing that soon one of many friendly faces will be glad to help you make sense of your new home.</a>

You don’t know much about drunkard’s tales,
but you do know that so far you’ve survived by scratching, crawling, lying, running, and hiding.
Human nature is the same everywhere...
Maybe life is different here, but so far you’ve only left behind your location —
the black cloud of misfortune that’s enveloped you since day one remains.
So, regardless of whether or not this place is or isn’t what they say it is or isn’t,
your freakish looks and savage ways will awaken freakish and savage things in anyone you come across.
Finding an intact and unexpired can of mushrooms is safer and 
more valuable than fnding a warm and smiling face.
The mushrooms won’t stab you in the back.
Keeping all this in mind, you decide to recede into the shadows and
<a href="./328.html">only make careful moves until you get a handle.</a>
