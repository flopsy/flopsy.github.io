<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You beckon for the Superhero with a few confdent ﬂicks of the wrist, 
after all, he puts food on the table thanks to you, in a way, and it only makes sense for him to treat you with kindness and professionalism.
He hands off a clipboard to a lieutenant and walks briskly over to you, smiling, clearly ready to provide some relief with a generous helping hand.
The closer he gets the queerer he looks, until you finally see it. His smile, ear-to-ear, is a smile only of the mouth, not the eyes.
The smile is wide but the eyes are hollow, relaxed, like a doll’s eyes.
The man walking over to you with his heater aimed at your crotch is a sadistic fend,
and his hand is not so helping.

You stutter one or two weak words about personal freedom before the first heatershotte vaporizes 
your manhood straight off like a high-speed sledgehammer hitting a pair of rotten grapes,
and now everybody’s breathing aerosolized testicles.
The searing pain between your legs makes you go blind for real, permanently.
Before the magnitude of your mistake can register, a killshotte to the head kills you.

-The End-
