This does not bode well. 
You don't really feel like undergoing a full sexual scan right now, 
plus you're two months overdue for Personality Enhancement Training (PET). 
Nobody really keeps up with these things to the letter, 
but not having your Personality Papers on hand to prove your 
Affability, Happiness, and Willingness (to submit to FEDGOV commands) (Tier 3 AHW) 
is technically a capital offense, 
and these troopers up ahead don't look like they'd have any problem putting a few holes in you,
just like they did to your adoptive parents so many G-Shock ago.

Squinting, you can just about make out a Peace Meister (low-level Cop-O' thug) 
swinging his heater around like a sword, probably warming up to bash some poor troggy's head in. 
They've got a speeder and a prison van stocked up with empty prison barrels for taking people away. 
They're probably trying to meet some sort of quota, and you might just be the next box that gets checked off. 

Today is going to be a very bad day.

Beyond the checkpoint, you see a derelict gas station,
and the solar sodium lamps (some still functioning) 
of the highway that must lead away from the city. 
If only there was some way to get over there… 
The thought has crossed your mind before but rumor has it the outlands are even
more fraught with dangers than the city. 
There’s also talk of some mythical suburb safe haven, Avalon, 
but that’s just a tale told by old fools and mountebanks. 
Still, the highway calls to you, and it looks like you might be dying today anyway.
<a class="one" href="./3.html">You square your shoulders and march towards the FEDGOV checkpoint.</a>


To the south — that’s back where you came from.
It’s a city, called Hell, because a city with no lights and no running soda,
inhabited by ghosts, villains, broken men with no empathy, rape-husks, 
and subhuman killfends, is Hell, and Helldwellers call it like they see it. 
It isn’t home and you don’t particularly want to go back,
<a class="one" href="./128.html">but maybe if you about-face casually enough, the Cop-O’s won’t notice you and hunt you down.</a>
