<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You take a broad, slow, non-menacing step out from your cover,
and clear your throat to make your presence known.
The seemingly frail old station attendant scrambles for the wrench and 
whips around faster than you would’ve thought possible.

“Fuck me!” he exclaims. Then, catching his breath,
“Mother, I thought you were bandits mister. Quick kid, you better get inside.”

You apologize for the fright and the old man explains that there’s soda inside,
and a bed where you can take a load off. 
In the meanwhile, he’ll refill your car with real gas, free of charge.
