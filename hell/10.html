<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
The freeway is more like a junkyard.
The shells of speeders, some forcibly decommissioned by heaterfire and Chennis rockets,
some just rotten with time, lay strewn about, making passage tricky.
The road is riddled with craters, many big enough to swallow your vehicle whole.
The shadows seem to move, and more than once you nearly lose your nerve and turn back,
but the gas station is close and you’re still alive.
It takes a lot of concentration but you make it.
Wiping sweat off your brow and breathing a sigh of relief you pull into
the Namerian Heroes rest stop and park under the brightly lit canopy.
And just in time too — one look down at the gauges let’s you know that the speeder is quite out of fuel.

You can’t remember the last time you saw a building with functioning lights,
let alone one as well-lit as this. Something is strange.
There’s nobody here, and why would anybody be here, at a gas station in the middle of a war zone?
The eerie buzz of ﬂowing current and the chatter of bugs underline the sinister energy here.
Maybe if you hang around long enough you’ll become a ghost.
A shadow moves inside the building and this time you are sure it’s not just your imagination.
It must be the friendly owner coming out to give you the helping hand you need so desperately.

---

Thankful for a helping hand,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/477.html">you step out of your speeder eagerly to greet the proprietor of this place.</a>

Caution would be best here.
While it’s probable the inhabitants of the gas station have your best interests at heart,
maybe hiding would serve you well for now.
There’s an overturned buss not too far past the concrete barrier at the edge of the highway.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/132.html">You crawl in there for a bit and wait to see what materializes.</a>

Nothing about this bodes well. The electric lights, the boarded up windows —
you have neither the time nor the inclination to 
stick around for this freaky oasis trap to spring itself on you.
You decide to hit the ground running, using the buss and other road wreckage for cover,
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/11.html">and making your way down the highway on foot.</a>
