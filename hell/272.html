<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
The man with salt-and-pepper hair fires up the orange Forb Fairmont that’s parked in the garage.
You can hear the supercharger belt’s high-pitched squeal over the low rumble of the motor.
After idling for a miniswatch or two and letting the car warm up,
he drives it out and parks again so that he can close up his stash.
Little does he know that in a few brief moments you will be pilfering said stash.
No door, no lock is safe from your deftly fingers and trusty lock pick.

With an ear-splitting roar, the man with salt-and-pepper hair chirps the tires and tears off down the alley.
When your ears tell you that he’s safely out of the area, you spring from your hiding place, 
giddy with excitement and licking your fingers.
What could be in the stash? Candied sweets? Cartons of coolers? Canned wieners in oil, dried noodles and chips?
It’s too much to think about, and so you focus on the task at hand.
Using your hammer lock pick, you get to work on the door.
After about twenty or thirty clean strikes, things are shaping up your way:
while the door isn’t busted down, there is a good-sized dent in the center of it.
You’ll get it soon…

Five miniswatches of banging later and the head of the hammer ﬂies off.
You’re sweating and exhausted, but even more determined now to access the treasure trove.
You’re not going to let some ﬂimsy piece of sheet metal stand between you and the motherlode.
You pace back and forth down the alley, out of breath, thinking to yourself that you’ll think
of something.
And you do.

Right there at your feet is a piece of rebar with a nice bit of knurling at one end — a fine lock pick if you ever saw one.
You are still swinging for the fences about a swatch later,
when to your great relief the door starts to show signs of letting up.
The roller mechanism in the upper right corner has come loose on the inside,
and it isn’t long before the whole assembly comes crashing down with a terrific clatter.
The feeling of success is overwhelming.
