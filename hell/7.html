“...’Cus she only eats rat pussy!”

You deliver your most vulgar and insensitive lesbian authority figure joke and the laughter of the Peace Meisters 
is just loud enough for you to infer that you probably won’t be killed today.
The sociopathic Superhero, chosen for his position based on his inability to empathize with other people,
nonetheless observes that his underlings are amused and therefore would not be happy to see you perforated cranially.
He lowers his weapon and laughs a dry, robotic laugh in an attempt to appear human.

It would appear that today is your lucky day:
you’ve talked your way through a Cop-O’ shakedown and that’s something not a lot of people can claim to have done.
You wonder if Roddy is up in Avalon right now, chowing down on a big double portion of clean soup and smiling at the good job you did.
He probably is.

---

Now’s as good a time as any to see what’s down that highway.
Whether it’s Avalon, or bandits, or Blowbang Gang territory, or just one big barren wasteland, fate is calling you.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/280.html">You’ve got fortune on your side, so it’s no big deal to head down the road on foot.</a> 


You’ll find what’s out there, sure.
But not down some highway that’s probably just one big ambush,
full of landmines and bandits camped behind junk cars waiting for a city scrub like you.
The dustway is clearly the smart move —
all those warnings about radiation are just tall tales for old cowards who wish they’d had the stones to leave the city.
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/8.html">You take a deep breath to fortify yourself and take the first courageous step out towards the.</a> 


<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/5.html">You decide to steal the speeder anyway.</a>


Looking out at the bombed-out highway full of junked speeders,
then over towards the red desert where the wind whips ups ghostlike dust devils to haunt the emptiness, you don’t like your prospects.
There are people still in Hell for a reason, and the outlands are empty for a reason,
and you’ve got a hunch those reasons are intricately tied to your general health and wellbeing. 
<a href="http://pomf.pw/hell/128.html">You start heading back.</a>
