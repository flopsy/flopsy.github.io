“Don’t know what your deal is dude,” you yell out over the whine of the blower,
“but I’ve had enough killin’ today! The only valuable here is your life,
and if you wanna keep it you better roll out!” 

The man with salt-and-pepper hair looks well-fed, confident, and ready for action.
It occurs to you that he’d make for a worthy companion, if he weren’t such a villain.
Reminds you of Roddy, in a way.
Utterly unfazed by your threat, he looks you up and down with a skeptical eye.
You must look pathetic, all rolled up in layer upon layer of rags, a bodyfrock that’s too small,
a patchwork rat carcass cloak, and of course your can opener necklace. 

“OK, Slick,” the man grunts, and eases on the gas.
With a low rumble, the car accelerates, lurching forward at first, 
but soon surging down the highway like a freight train until it’s out of view and can only be heard.
