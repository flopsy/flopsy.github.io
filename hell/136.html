<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You glance at the ReGreen kid-safe dumpster and brieﬂy contemplate hiding in there.
Once, during a red ﬂood, you and Roddy had shared a small dumpster for what seemed like 
weeks but as it turned out had only been days. What a time… 
It felt like the world was ending, but now, looking back, it was the world beginning.
Despite all your fond memories, dumpsters are usually more trouble than they’re worth.
As they are the closest thing in Hell to durable shelter,
they are highly sought after and almost always crowded.

This high demand and leads to certain other dangers.
For example, spray and lay, the practice of poking a heater under the lid and
indiscriminately fring two, three, or a dozen shots at whatever may be inside, so that it’s safe for sleeping.
The problem arises later on when you’re trying to sleep and the next lodger comes along to perforate you.
Higher up in dumpster real estate value would be armored dumpsters,
at which point you’re really better of going with a storage unit or retrofitting a drainage ditch — 
two of the safest and most underutilized modern dwellings, in your opinion at least.

You carry on down past the dumpster and deep into the alleyway,
in search of a pile of trash or some other sort of trash structure to stay warm.
The brick walls are slick and wet with a slimy green flim, cold.
The pavement is lukewarm, and it seems to heave and pulse under your feet, almost as if you’re walking on freshly baked bread.
The notion of the pavement being alive —
living and breathing, excreting satoig from its creases in an upwards direction along all the walls —
makes you physically sick, and you almost vomit.
Almost vomit, but mustn’t, not with a belly full of peanut brittle that you spent two days searching for, you’ve gotta keep that down.
And if it does come up, well… You were expecting to see trash and debris piled high,
but there’s little in the way of refuse.
The walls are dark, red and brown, full of nutrients you imagine, and the pavement looks as if it just rained.
