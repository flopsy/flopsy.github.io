<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
You jog along the smooth, new pavement for what seems like forever.
You try your best to put the drudgery of it out of your mind,
but you can’t help looking back every hundred paces and measuring your progress by comparing the curve
of the highway with the shape of the barren mountains to the southwest and the hazy skyline of Hell behind you. 
By your crude calculations, you haven’t moved much.

The sun is a dull red stain in the sky,
and the stars are a constant reminder that there are a million better worlds:
young worlds not yet ruined, worlds full of advanced and noble races,
worlds where savagery and fear and hunger are ancient history or in the process of becoming ancient history.
You’ll be ancient history soon too.
You are a tired crumb spiraling down a drain into a garbage disposal.
The pulsing heat and dry air feel like a heavy coat, heavier with each step.

The next time you turn around like fool to check your progress, a glimmer on the horizon catches your eye.
Your frst instinct is fear, but there’s nowhere to hide.
Jumping over the side would mean death, you’re sure of it.
If not instant death, at least a broken leg, which here in the outlands would be fatal,
though a broken leg would be fatal in the city too, most likely.
Even a rolled ankle is usually fatal,
just ask Cowardly Joel who did in fact lose his life after rolling both ankles.

The glimmering speck is soaring along a big sweeping curve at breakneck speed.
It’s an orange car — a dark orange car, maybe a Forb.
The car is about twenty quads away, and evidently the driver has noticed you, 
because he downshifts one gear with an ear-splitting blip.
It’s still surging forward, but no longer threatening to break the sound barrier.
You can see clearly that it’s a Forb Fairmont with a wide-mouthed blower poking through the hood.
The man in the driver’s seat is quite possibly the oldest man you’ve ever seen,
at least forty, maybe fifty, with salt-and-pepper hair, a pitted, gravelly face, and a red goatee.
He stops right alongside you.

“Any valuables?” 

---

This man will definitely kill you.
If you jump off the highway, perhaps you can land in a certain way, such as to minimize damage.
Roddy had shown you a few gymnastic tricks during your before bedtime gymnastics lessons,
and if you recall correctly, there is a way to tuck and roll immediately
upon landing that distributes force evenly and enables the performer to
fall from distances that are ten times those safely managed by a normal person.
<a href="./129.html">You make a break for the edge of the road and do an amazing swan dive.</a>

“The best defense is a strong fist”— one of Roddy’s original maxims.
You can sense this man’s evil intent, 
which is more than enough provocation for you to launch a preemptive counter-attack.
<a href="./134.html">You jump through his window, hands poised to strangle and maim.</a>

You’d be ill advised either to fght or run here —
he’s got an edge on you in both counts.
What he doesn’t know is that they call you Shine-Po,
and that you learned to bluff from The Pipe King Twosoup — Roddy,
that is — the very best of the best when it comes to stringin’ a fib or two.
<a href="./131.html">You attempt to bluff your way out of this.</a>

Every option comes with sticky consequences.
It occurs to you that maybe for once in your life you could tell the truth,
wagering that this guy isn’t a complete maniac and hasn’t already made up his mind to smoke you.
<a href="./544.html">You explain that you’ve got no valuables besides your rat carcass cloak and can opener necklace.</a>
