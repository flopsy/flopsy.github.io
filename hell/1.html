<H1>ANOTHER DAY IN HELL</H1>
<pre class="top">
Another day in Hell, the last city on Big Bom, at least as far as anyone can be sure.
Most people don’t think about things like that anymore—they’ve got more pressing matters to attend to,
such as finding cans of tomato paste for sustenance, and building trash huts to ward off the icy Hell night.

Hell is the unofcial name, of course.
The people here don’t read and can’t remember much, so when the picture tubes went dim,
and the street signs and advertisements began to fade,
they had to start making up names for things.
You’ve heard it said that ages ago someone suggested ‘Hell’ as a joke,
before it started to get real bad,
and over the G-Shocks the joke started wearing thin,
until eventually it ft like a glove and people stopped asking about it.

Here, folks scavenge to make ends meet, and that’s what you are by trade: a scavenger,
as well as a rat, backstabber, and thief.
No friends, no family to call your own, only gangs, gangs to be feared and avoided.

The worst gang of all is the Cop-O’s.
They call themselves FEDGOV and take themselves real serious, always strutting around and making a big show, 
but we call them Cop-O’s and they’re a gang like any other. 
G-Shocks back they were a part of the Wasters, just a little clan of murdering punks on the outer rings of the big Waster gang, 
but one day their leader, Sterno — a really fucked up but ambitious operator—found a huge cache of old-time gear, the good stuff, 
and that’s supposedly how they came to be so powerful.

Today you fgured you’d head to one of the richer scrap zones on the outskirts of the city and
maybe find yourself a nice lead pipe or some ripped up magazines (the sort that have pictures on the paper). 
Taking calculated risks like this is the only way to get an edge as a scavenger,
and you usually come out on top in the outskirts, but today it plays out all wrong.


There’s a FEDGOV checkpoint.
